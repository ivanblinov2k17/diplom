### An image secret sharing method based on Shamir Secret Sharing 2018

Method based on Naor Shamir 1995, proposes a method without growing file size and
losses in quality or contrast

### Long Article with theorems

Probably not really connected to our theme, but some useful references ther

### Multi Secret Image Rajput

Sometimes (n, n+1) MSIS provide partial information about image
with k < n shares, provides mehod to disable this
Also uses modular arithmetics to reduce time spent on decrypting

### Shamir's article

2 page article from the author of algorithm
Basic principles of sharing secret

### Naor Shamir 1995

Sharing secret applied to images
Problems of proposed scheme: 1 pixel of secret image is mapped into several
pixels in shared transparencies, so there is loss in contrast and resolution, also
image size increased

### A-k-n threshold

Naor Shamir's image algorithm without expansion to multiple pixels, but with loss in contrast

### ISSS_Bai_Biswas

Matrix projection combined with shamir's iss, decrypting in real time (but no info provided about
possibility of exposing secret in less than k shares)

### Reversible Iss

Cool article about hiding info in noise of another images and reconstructing original image
